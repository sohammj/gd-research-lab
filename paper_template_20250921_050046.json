  "title": "Predicting Employee Attrition in the Tech Industry: A Mixed-Methods Approach Integrating Psychological Factors and Sub-Sector Analysis",
  "abstract": "Employee attrition poses a significant challenge to the tech industry, impacting productivity and profitability. This study investigates the predictive relationship between organizational commitment, job satisfaction, and burnout on employee attrition within the tech sector, considering the unique characteristics of various sub-sectors (e.g., software development, data science, cybersecurity).  We employ a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis of readily available HR datasets with qualitative insights from online discussions (Reddit).  Quantitative analysis involves building and comparing predictive models using machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting, to identify the most accurate predictors of attrition across sub-sectors. Qualitative analysis, through thematic analysis of Reddit discussions, will explore employee perspectives on burnout and attrition drivers to contextualize the quantitative findings.  Triangulation of these methods will provide a comprehensive understanding of employee attrition dynamics in the tech industry, offering actionable insights for retention strategies tailored to specific sub-sectors.  The findings will contribute to the existing literature by providing a more nuanced understanding of attrition within the diverse tech landscape and advancing predictive modeling techniques for improved HR practices.",

      "content": "The tech industry faces a persistent challenge: high rates of employee attrition. This phenomenon significantly impacts productivity, innovation, and profitability.  The cost of replacing employees, including recruitment, training, and lost productivity, is substantial. While general studies on employee attrition exist, a focused examination of the issue within the diverse tech landscape, considering sub-sector variations, is lacking. This research addresses this gap by investigating the predictive relationship between key psychological factors—organizational commitment, job satisfaction, and burnout—and employee attrition in the tech industry, with a specific focus on the differential impact across various tech sub-sectors.  The study aims to develop robust predictive models that can assist organizations in proactively addressing attrition risks and implementing targeted retention strategies.",

We will explore established theoretical frameworks such as the job demands-resources model and the social exchange theory to understand the underlying mechanisms driving attrition. The review will also delve into existing research on employee attrition within the tech industry, analyzing studies that have explored similar factors.  Furthermore, the review will examine the existing literature on predictive modeling techniques used in HR analytics, specifically focusing on machine learning algorithms. Finally, we will explore the limitations of previous research and highlight the unique contributions of this study. ",

The quantitative phase will involve analyzing existing HR datasets from tech companies (if accessible, otherwise simulated data will be used, acknowledging limitations).  We will build predictive models using logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting machines, comparing their performance in predicting attrition across different tech sub-sectors (software development, data science, cybersecurity).  Key variables will include organizational commitment (measured using validated scales), job satisfaction (measured using standardized questionnaires), burnout (measured using Maslach Burnout Inventory), and attrition (binary variable indicating whether an employee left the company within a specified timeframe). The qualitative phase will involve thematic analysis of publicly available discussions on platforms like Reddit, focusing on employee experiences related to burnout and attrition drivers within these sub-sectors. This will help contextualize the quantitative findings and identify potential unmeasured variables. Triangulation of quantitative and qualitative results will be crucial for robust conclusions.",
